Extract: AfriForum is on a roll. No, not a bread roll. Please, stop imagining a tiny, angry man made out of very pink polony, dressed in teensy little khaki dungarees, struggling to get out of a bun. I mean AfriForum is going places. Granted, they’re not places where anyone has read a book, but still, AfriForum is partying like it’s 1948. Firstly, it’s got a new movie in theatres, and by “theatres” I mean the laptops of its members, sharing hard-drive space with Steve Hofmeyr’s cover of The Ballad of the Green Berets and a manuscript for an illustrated children’s book about why Caucasian Jesus hates Communists. (I’m not joking about the Hofmeyr song. Search for it on YouTube. On the device of someone you really, really dislike.)
