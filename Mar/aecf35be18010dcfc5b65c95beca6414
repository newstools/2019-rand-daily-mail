Extract: President Cyril Ramaphosa’s first order of business after the elections should surely be to make sure Busisiwe Mkhwebane is relieved of her job. She needs to go. She should not be allowed to stay a day longer in her post. Every hour, every minute, she stays in the job she tarnishes the good name of what has been the finest of the chapter nine institutions. Otherwise she will do enormous damage to the country or even reverse whatever changes Ramaphosa has initiated since assuming office. Her misguided decisions and findings have the force of the law. They’re binding. What’s so scary is that she doesn’t seem to be that bright; like a child in a candy shop she’s besotted by the untrammelled powers she wields. She’s therefore almost oblivious of the damage that she can cause. Power, especially when it’s unfettered, is most useful to society when applied with care and circumspection.
