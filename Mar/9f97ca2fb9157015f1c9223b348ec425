Extract The greatest threat to our country is the fact that the extraordinary, the outrageous, the crooked, may end up being viewed as the norm. Crime used to be top of the agenda in SA. It was the main issue of debate on talk radio, the main headline in daily newspapers and the subject of special investigations on television programmes. It hasn’t gone away. Murders, rapes, robberies and hijackings are still the order of the day in large chunks of Cape Town, Joburg and other parts of the country. But these incidents are no longer in the headlines. Crime has become normalised in our society. Those who are killed, maimed and raped suffer alone, ignored by us. They cry alone. What is horrific is now normalised.
